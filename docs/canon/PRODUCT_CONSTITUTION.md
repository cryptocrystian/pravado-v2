# PRAVADO v2 — PRODUCT CONSTITUTION
Version: v1.0 (Canon)

## Mission
Pravado is an AI-native Visibility Operating System.
It unifies PR, Content, and SEO into a single orchestrated system driven by SAGE (strategy mesh) and governed by AUTOMATE (execution layer), with CiteMind as the intelligence engine for AEO/citation visibility.

## Non-Negotiable Truths
- Pravado is a first-class PR + Content + SEO platform (not an "insights layer").
- SAGE + AUTOMATE overlays are central and visible in-product.
- Cross-pillar orchestration is experiential: "this insight caused that action."
- Each pillar must be best-in-class, not MVP-lite.
- AEO/Citation intelligence is powered by CiteMind and surfaced in Analytics/Reporting and intelligence views.

## Pillars and Surfaces
- Work Surfaces: PR, Content, SEO
- Execution Surface: Cross-Pillar Orchestration Calendar
- Intelligence/Measurement: Analytics & Reporting (includes CiteMind)

## Intelligence Principles
- Automation must always be labeled, explainable, and interruptible.
- No silent automation.
- No dead-end drilldowns.

## Success Definition
Pravado functions as a self-optimizing visibility system:
- Users can run Manual → Copilot → Autopilot per pillar
- The platform proposes and executes coordinated actions across pillars
- Performance feedback influences future proposals (guardrailed, explainable)

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] SAGE is visible in UX as a mesh (not hidden architecture)
- [ ] AUTOMATE is visible as execution/logs/queue/calendar causality
- [ ] PR/Content/SEO each have real workflows (not "empty pages")
- [ ] Analytics reports outcomes + causality, not provider-internal cost mechanics
