## Pravado — Content Work Surface (Best-in-Class Execution + AI Governance)

**Status:** CANONICAL · DO NOT INTERPRET · DO NOT SIMPLIFY
**Audience:** Product, UX, Engineering, AI Agents (Claude Code)
**Precedence:** Below PR_PILLAR_CANON, Above Sprint Docs

## 0. Canon Rules (Read This First)

- This document is authoritative.
- If UI, code, or AI output conflicts with this document, this document wins.
- No feature is removed, simplified, or reframed without an explicit canon update.
- "Best-in-class" here means competitive parity + Pravado-exclusive advantages, not MVP shortcuts.

## 1. Why the Content Pillar Exists (Non-Negotiable)

### The Core Question We Must Win

> Why would I move from my current content platform to Pravado?

If the Content pillar does not convincingly answer this, the pillar fails.

### The Reality of the Market

Users already have:

- CMSs (WordPress, Webflow, Headless CMSs)
- SEO content tools (Surfer, Clearscope, MarketMuse)
- AI writers (Jasper, Copy.ai, Notion AI)
- Editorial workflows (Airtable, Asana, Google Docs)
- Distribution tools (Hootsuite, Buffer, Sprout)

**Pravado does NOT win by replacing all of these individually.**

**Pravado wins by doing something they cannot do together.**

---

## 2. What the Content Pillar Is (Precise Definition)

> The Content Pillar is an enterprise-grade content intelligence, planning, production, and optimization work surface that transforms content from isolated assets into compounding authority signals across PR, AEO, and AI discovery.

It is:
- A best-in-class content execution environment
- Governed by CiteMind trust constraints
- Orchestrated by AUTOMATE
- Strategically guided by SAGE

It is not:
- A blog editor
- A social posting scheduler only
- A generic AI writing tool
- A growth-hack content mill

---

## 3. Competitive Parity (Table Stakes — Must Exist)

If Pravado does not at least match these, users will not switch.

### 3.1 Core Content Capabilities (Required)

- Content calendar (multi-format)
- Long-form writing (articles, guides, landing pages)
- Short-form writing (social, snippets, summaries)
- Editorial workflow:
  - Draft → Review → Approved → Published
  - Versioning and revision history
  - Collaboration (comments, suggestions)
- Basic performance metrics (views, engagement, CTR where available)

> ⚠️ **Important:**
> These are table stakes, not differentiators. They must feel polished, not "good enough."

---

## 4. Pravado Differentiation (Why Users Switch)

This is where the pillar becomes best-in-class, not just competitive.

### 4.1 Content Is Treated as Authority Infrastructure

Other tools ask:
> "Is this content optimized?"

Pravado asks:
> "Does this content increase AI-readable authority?"

Every piece of content is evaluated as:
- An entity reinforcement
- A citation opportunity
- An AI ingestion signal

**This is the fundamental shift.**

### 4.2 CiteMind Governance (Non-Optional)

The Content Pillar operates inside CiteMind constraints.

That means:
- Claims must be verifiable
- Assertions must be entity-grounded
- Sources must be citation-worthy
- Repetition must be intentional, not spammy

> CiteMind does not write content.
> CiteMind qualifies content.

This prevents:
- AI hallucination risk
- Over-optimization
- Trust dilution

### 4.3 Content Is Multi-Surface by Default

Content is never "just a blog post."

Each asset has:
- **Primary format** (e.g., long-form article)
- **Secondary derivatives:**
  - PR pitch excerpts
  - AEO snippets
  - AI-ready summaries
  - Social fragments
- **Cross-pillar hooks** (PR, AEO, Command Center)

**This is structural reuse, not manual repurposing.**

---

## 5. Automation Philosophy (Extremely Important)

### 5.1 Manual → Copilot → Automation Ladder

Content follows the same philosophy as PR:

| Mode | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| Manual | Human creates and approves |
| Copilot | AI assists, human decides |
| Automation | AI executes within constraints |

> 🚫 **There is no "set it and forget it" content publishing.**

Why?
- Content directly affects brand trust
- Content feeds AI systems
- Mistakes compound negatively

### 5.2 What AI Is Allowed to Do

AI may:
- Draft within structured outlines
- Suggest improvements
- Generate variants
- Identify gaps
- Optimize for clarity and consistency

AI may not:
- Invent facts
- Publish without approval
- Override CiteMind constraints
- Optimize solely for volume or frequency

---

## 6. UX Philosophy (Best-in-Class Bar)

### 6.1 The Content Work Surface Must Feel Like:

- A professional editorial command center
- Calm, deliberate, structured
- Zero "AI spam" vibes
- No gimmicks, no novelty UI

**This is enterprise-grade, not creator-tool aesthetics.**

### 6.2 Core Views (Required)

**Content Overview**
- Authority impact
- Active themes
- AI ingestion readiness

**Content Calendar**
- Multi-format
- Cross-pillar visibility

**Content Editor**
- Long-form
- Structured sections
- CiteMind feedback inline

**Content Library**
- All assets
- Filters by entity, topic, pillar

**Optimization & Insights**
- Authority deltas
- Citation readiness
- Competitive gaps

---

## 7. Metrics That Matter (Not Vanity)

Content is not judged by word count or posting frequency.

### 7.1 Primary Metrics

- Authority Contribution Score
- Citation Eligibility Score
- AI Ingestion Likelihood
- Cross-Pillar Impact (PR + AEO)
- Competitive Authority Delta

### 7.2 Secondary Metrics

- Engagement (only as supporting signal)
- Distribution performance
- Repurposing efficiency

---

## 8. What Users Gain vs Lose (Explicit)

### 8.1 What They Gain

- Content that compounds across channels
- AI-readable authority
- Reduced duplication
- Strategic clarity
- Governance and safety

### 8.2 What They Lose (And Why That's Okay)

- Pure growth-hack volume tactics
- Black-box AI writing
- Spammy optimization tricks

**Pravado intentionally rejects low-trust behaviors.**

---

## 9. Relationship to Other Pillars

### 9.1 With PR

- Content feeds pitches
- Pitches reinforce content
- Coverage loops back into authority

### 9.2 With AEO / SEO

- Content structured for AI answers
- Snippets extracted automatically
- Authority scores shared

### 9.3 With Command Center

- Content actions surface as strategic levers
- Authority movement tracked globally

---

## 10. Explicit Non-Goals (Lock This)

The Content Pillar will **not** become:
- A social media scheduler clone
- A keyword stuffing tool
- A viral content generator
- A generic AI writer

**Those are deliberate exclusions.**

---

## 11. Implementation Guardrails (For Engineers & AI)

- CiteMind constraints must be enforced at generation time
- No content can bypass governance
- All automation must be explainable
- All authority changes must be traceable

---

## 12. Definition of "Best-in-Class" (Final)

Pravado Content is best-in-class because:

1. It matches incumbents where required
2. Exceeds them where it matters
3. Compounds value across pillars
4. Aligns with the future of AI discovery
