# PRAVADO v2 — DS v3 PRINCIPLES
Version: v1.0 (Canon)

## Purpose
Define design principles for an AI-native, premium command center.

## Principles
- Form over fashion, but premium and intentional
- Semantic colors; neon accents are functional, not decorative
- Strong hierarchy: proposals + causality dominate
- Micro-interactions are meaningful and restrained
- Density tuned for power users; progressive disclosure for complexity

## Layout Canon
Tri-pane Command Center is primary.
Responsive: 3-col desktop, 2-col tablet, 1-col mobile.

## Interaction Canon
- drawers for inspection ("peek")
- clear states: proposed → queued → running → done
- live indicators subtle and purposeful

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] No "amateur dashboard" look
- [ ] Visual hierarchy supports decision-making
- [ ] System feels AI-native (environment, not widgets)
