# PRAVADO — SPRINT ZERO DEMO SCRIPT (HOLLOW UI)

## Goal
Demonstrate the full AI-native experience using mock JSON, end-to-end.

## Demo Path
1) Command Center loads (tri-pane)
   - Left: Action Stream populated
   - Center: Intelligence Canvas populated
   - Right: Strategic Panel populated

2) Click an Action Card (PR opportunity)
   - Drill-down shows "why" + confidence
   - "Review" opens peek drawer
   - "Schedule" routes to Calendar with prefilled item

3) Calendar (week view)
   - Item shows pillar badge, mode, status
   - Drill-down shows triggers and dependencies

4) PR Work Surface
   - Filter journalists by beat/freshness/openness
   - Open journalist profile
   - Show match explanation

5) Analytics & Reporting
   - Show causality and attribution paths
   - Generate report preview

6) Omni-Tray (support)
   - Ask "why" about a recommendation
   - No execution occurs from tray

## Exit Criteria
- No dead ends
- Automation visibility is clear
- Experience feels "AI-native" with mock data

(End)
