# PRAVADO v2 — PLANS, LIMITS & ENTITLEMENTS
Version: v1.0 (Canon)

## Principle
All plans include all pillars; differentiation is depth, scale, autonomy, visibility.

## Plans (v1)
Starter:
- 1 user
- Manual + Copilot only
- limited executions + limited database depth
- CiteMind summary insights only

Pro:
- 3–5 users
- full Copilot + limited Autopilot for low-risk workflows
- full CiteMind visibility
- advanced analytics + reporting
- higher quotas (journalists, pitches, runs)

Enterprise:
- custom users
- per-pillar mode control (incl Autopilot)
- RBAC/SSO, approval chains, audit, custom reporting
- custom limits and cost controls

## Trial
14 days, no CC:
- Copilot only
- strict caps
- cheaper LLM policies
- reduced visibility where needed to control cost

## Upgrade Pressure (non-annoying)
Allowed patterns:
- blurred insights
- action caps
- safety alerts
Avoid popups/dark patterns.

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] entitlements are dimensions (not hardcoded)
- [ ] trial protects costs
- [ ] upgrades are contextual and informative
