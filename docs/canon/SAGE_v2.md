# PRAVADO v2 — SAGE v2 SPEC
Version: v1.0 (Canon)

## Purpose
SAGE is Pravado's strategy mesh: it decides WHAT to do next and WHY across PR, Content, and SEO, including Exposure.

## Definitions
S = Signal (PR intelligence, narrative opportunities, media dynamics)
A = Authority (content, entity strength, trust signals)
G = Growth (distribution reach, amplification)
E = Exposure (measured visibility outcomes across channels and AI surfaces)

## Core Model
SAGE is a feedback mesh, not a linear funnel.
Each pillar emits events; SAGE converts events into prioritized proposals.

## Inputs (examples)
- PR: journalist trends, coverage detected, pitch performance
- Content: topic gaps, publishing cadence, engagement
- SEO: ingestibility, technical blockers, keyword opportunity
- CiteMind: citations, Share of Model, entity sentiment, time-to-citation

## Outputs (proposal requirements)
Every proposal MUST include:
- Why (source signals + reasoning summary)
- Confidence (0–1)
- Expected impact (qualitative + metric targets if known)
- Risk tier (low/med/high)
- Mode eligibility (manual/copilot/autopilot)
- Required approvals (by tier/org settings)
- Trace links to dependencies and expected outcomes

## Exposure ("E") Requirement
Exposure is explicitly measured and visible:
- outcomes tied back to actions
- cross-pillar attribution
- AI visibility/citation signals via CiteMind surfaced as exposure outcomes

## UX Requirement
SAGE must be visible via:
- causality ("insight → proposal → execution → outcome")
- cross-pillar links (calendar dependencies + analytics trails)
- strategy narrative (Command Center right panel + reporting)

## Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Exposure ("E") exists as measurable outcomes, not implied
- [ ] Every proposal has a traceable "why"
- [ ] Cross-pillar reinforcement is visible, not conceptual
