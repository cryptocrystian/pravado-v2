## Usage Guidelines

This document provides structured responses to common sales objections. Each response:
1. Acknowledges the objection
2. Reframes the concern
3. Maps to SAGE/EVI/AUTOMATE logic
4. Provides proof points when available

**Do NOT read responses verbatim.** Adapt to conversation context.

---

## Objection 1: "We already use X"

### Variations
- "We're locked into HubSpot/Meltwater/Semrush for another 18 months."
- "We just finished migrating to our current stack."
- "Our team knows these tools and doesn't want to switch."

### Underlying Concern
Change fatigue. Investment protection. Team resistance.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"That makes sense. Your team has invested in building workflows around those tools, and there's real value in that institutional knowledge."

**Reframe:**
"What I hear from most marketing leaders in your position isn't that their tools are broken—it's that the tools don't talk to each other. When a PR hit lands, does your SEO tool know? When you publish content, does your PR team see the pitch opportunity it creates?"

**SAGE Connection:**
"This is exactly what SAGE solves. It's not about replacing your tools—it's about connecting them. SAGE sits above your existing stack and creates the cross-domain intelligence layer that doesn't exist today.

Think of it like this: your tools are the instruments. SAGE is the conductor. Without a conductor, you have talented musicians playing in isolation. With a conductor, you have an orchestra."

**EVI Connection:**
"Here's the concrete question: Can you tell me today, in a single number, how visible your brand is across PR, content, and SEO? Not three dashboards—one number. That's EVI. Your current tools can't give you that because they don't share state."

### Proof Points
- Integration story: "We have customers running Pravado alongside HubSpot, Semrush, and Meltwater. The integration timeline is typically 2-3 weeks, not months."
- Parallel value: "You keep using your existing tools for execution. Pravado provides the intelligence layer on top."

### Close Direction
"Would it be valuable to see how Pravado would connect your current stack without replacing it?"

---

## Objection 2: "This sounds complicated"

### Variations
- "Our team is overwhelmed already—they can't learn another system."
- "How long will implementation take?"
- "We don't have bandwidth for a major technology project."

### Underlying Concern
Capacity constraints. Implementation risk. Cognitive load.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"I appreciate you raising that. The last thing any marketing leader needs is more complexity. Your team is already stretched."

**Reframe:**
"Here's what's actually complicated: managing PR, Content, and SEO as three separate operations with three separate tools, three separate meetings, and three separate reports. That's the status quo complexity tax.

Pravado reduces complexity. Instead of coordinating across tools manually—which is what your team spends time on today—SAGE does the coordination automatically."

**SAGE Connection:**
"Think about what SAGE actually does: it reads signals from everywhere, figures out what matters, and tells you what to do next. That's not adding complexity—that's removing the cognitive load of pattern recognition that currently lives in your team's heads.

The proposals SAGE generates come with context: why this matters, what the confidence level is, what the expected impact is. Your team doesn't have to figure that out—they just decide whether to act."

**AUTOMATE Connection:**
"And here's the key: you control the automation level. Start in Manual mode. Your team sees every proposal and decides. As they get comfortable, move to Copilot—the system assists but humans approve. Autopilot only happens when you're ready, for actions you trust."

### Proof Points
- Time to value: "Most customers see their first EVI baseline within the first week. Proposals start flowing immediately based on existing data."
- Implementation scope: "We're not asking you to rebuild your marketing operation. We're adding an intelligence layer that makes your existing operation smarter."

### Close Direction
"What if we started with a 30-day pilot where your team runs Pravado in read-only mode? No execution, no change management—just visibility into what SAGE would recommend. Would that help you evaluate without adding load?"

---

## Objection 3: "How is this different from SEO?"

### Variations
- "This sounds like SEO with extra steps."
- "We already have an SEO agency."
- "Isn't this just keyword tracking with AI?"

### Underlying Concern
Category confusion. Budget allocation. Incumbent relationship.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"I understand the confusion—a lot of what's marketed as 'AI marketing' is really just SEO with a chatbot. Let me be direct about what Pravado actually is."

**Reframe:**
"SEO is one of three domains Pravado orchestrates. It's important, but it's a pillar—not the building.

Here's the fundamental difference: SEO tools optimize for search engines. Pravado optimizes for visibility across AI systems, search engines, and media coverage simultaneously.

When AI answer engines—ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity—cite sources, they're not following SEO rules. They're evaluating authority, structure, and citation patterns. That's a different game."

**SAGE Connection:**
"SAGE tracks visibility across all surfaces where decisions are made:
- AI answer engines (do they cite you?)
- Search results (do you rank?)
- Media coverage (do journalists write about you?)

These surfaces interact. A TechCrunch feature boosts your domain authority, which helps your rankings, which makes you more citable by AI models. SEO tools see one piece. SAGE sees the system."

**EVI Connection:**
"Your EVI score synthesizes visibility across all three surfaces. An SEO tool might tell you that you rank #4 for a keyword. EVI tells you whether you're visible in the places decisions are made—and whether that visibility is growing or declining."

### Proof Points
- AI visibility gap: "For most brands, AI citation is a blind spot. SEO tools don't track it. Pravado does. How often is your brand cited when someone asks an AI model about your category?"
- Cross-domain attribution: "When we show customers how a PR hit from six weeks ago is still influencing their SEO rankings today, they realize what they've been missing."

### Close Direction
"Let's run a quick AI citation audit. We'll show you how often your brand versus your competitors appears in AI model responses. That's data your SEO tool can't give you."

---

## Objection 4: "Why trust automation?"

### Variations
- "We've been burned by automation before."
- "I need humans making decisions, not robots."
- "What happens when the AI makes a mistake?"

### Underlying Concern
Loss of control. Past negative experiences. Brand risk.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"That skepticism is healthy. Bad automation is worse than no automation. If your team has been burned by 'set it and forget it' tools that made mistakes at scale, you're right to be cautious."

**Reframe:**
"Pravado's automation is fundamentally different because we built governance in from the start. This isn't about taking humans out of the loop—it's about putting humans at the right place in the loop."

**AUTOMATE Connection:**
"Here's how AUTOMATE works:

First, you control the mode:
- **Manual**: SAGE proposes, you decide and execute
- **Copilot**: SAGE proposes and prepares, you approve, system executes
- **Autopilot**: System executes within tight guardrails you define

Second, every action has a risk classification:
- Low risk, high confidence: eligible for automation
- High risk, any confidence: requires human approval
- External-facing actions: always require approval

Third, trust is earned:
- You start in Manual mode
- The system demonstrates reliability
- You graduate to Copilot when you're ready
- Autopilot is optional and only for proven patterns"

**Audit Trail:**
"Every action—whether human-initiated or automated—has a full audit trail: why it was proposed, what confidence level was calculated, who approved it, what the outcome was. You can see exactly why anything happened."

### Proof Points
- Guardrails example: "We have customers who run Copilot for internal content scheduling but keep external PR in Manual. The system respects that boundary."
- Failure handling: "When an automated action fails, the system learns. That pattern gets demoted, and similar actions require higher confidence thresholds going forward."

### Close Direction
"Would it help to see the audit trail from a real customer deployment? You can see exactly how the governance layer works in practice."

---

## Objection 5: "How long until value?"

### Variations
- "We need quick wins, not another long implementation."
- "What's the time to ROI?"
- "When will we see results?"

### Underlying Concern
Budget justification. Patience limits. Stakeholder pressure.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"Fair question. Marketing leaders are under pressure to show results, and 'enterprise software' often means 'wait 6 months to see anything.' Let me break down the actual timeline."

**Reframe:**
"There's a difference between 'time to value' and 'time to full value.' You'll see value on day one. You'll see compounding value over months."

**Immediate Value (Week 1):**
"Within the first week:
- EVI baseline established—you know your starting position
- SAGE proposals flowing—you see what the system recommends
- Cross-pillar gaps visible—you see what's been invisible

This is intelligence value. Even if you never execute an action through Pravado, you'll understand your visibility landscape better than you do today."

**SAGE Connection:**
"SAGE starts generating proposals immediately because it's reading signals from your existing presence—your rankings, your coverage, your content. It doesn't require months of setup to have opinions."

**Early Wins (Week 2-4):**
"By the end of the first month:
- First proposals executed—typically content or SEO quick wins
- Attribution visible—you see how actions affect EVI
- Patterns emerging—you see which proposal types work for you"

**Compounding Value (Month 2+):**
"This is where Pravado separates from point tools. Because of the feedback loop:
- Success patterns are reinforced
- Cross-pillar effects compound
- EVI trajectory becomes predictable

We typically see EVI improvement of 15-25% in the first 90 days for engaged customers."

**EVI Connection:**
"Here's the simple way to think about it: How much is a 10-point EVI increase worth? If that increase means showing up in AI answers where you currently don't, or landing coverage that's going to competitors, what's that worth in pipeline?"

### Proof Points
- Customer timeline: "Customer X saw their first EVI movement in 14 days after executing three SAGE proposals."
- Quick win examples: "Most common early wins: content refresh recommendations, journalist timing opportunities, technical SEO fixes."

### Close Direction
"What would a quick win look like for you? If we could show impact in the first 30 days, what would move the needle for your team?"

---

## Objection 6: "This is too expensive"

### Variations
- "We can't justify this spend right now."
- "How does this compare to our current tool costs?"
- "What's the ROI?"

### Underlying Concern
Budget constraints. Value justification. Competing priorities.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"Budget pressure is real. Every dollar needs to justify itself, especially in the current environment."

**Reframe:**
"Let's talk about what you're currently spending—not just on tools, but on the hidden costs of fragmentation:
- How much time does your team spend coordinating across tools?
- How many cross-pillar opportunities are missed because signals don't connect?
- What's the cost of delayed response to opportunities that expired?

Pravado isn't an add-on cost. It's a consolidation of intelligence that should reduce your overall stack cost while increasing output."

**ROI Calculation:**
"Here's a simple way to think about ROI:

**Input Efficiency:**
- Coordination overhead reduction: 20-30% of marketing team time
- Tool consolidation: Typically 30-40% of current stack spend
- Faster execution: SAGE proposals reduce decision latency

**Output Improvement:**
- Cross-pillar reinforcement: Actions become 30% more effective when coordinated
- Opportunity capture: Catch time-sensitive signals that currently expire
- EVI improvement: 15-25% typical in first 90 days"

**EVI Value Connection:**
"What's a 10-point EVI increase worth? Let's calculate:
- If improved visibility means 10% more organic traffic...
- If that traffic has a value of $X per visit...
- Over 12 months, that's $Y in value

Now compare that to Pravado cost."

### Proof Points
- Customer savings: "Customer X consolidated three tools into Pravado and saved $40K/year in tool costs alone—before counting efficiency gains."
- Time savings: "Marketing coordinator time freed up from cross-tool coordination averages 8-12 hours/week."

### Close Direction
"Let's do a quick ROI calculation specific to your situation. What's your current tool spend across PR, content, and SEO? What's the value of your organic traffic?"

---

## Objection 7: "We tried something like this before"

### Variations
- "We bought a marketing platform and it didn't deliver."
- "This sounds like the all-in-one platform pitch we've heard before."
- "We went back to best-of-breed for a reason."

### Underlying Concern
Scar tissue from past failures. Skepticism about category. Preference for point solutions.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"I appreciate you sharing that. Failed platform implementations are painful—significant investment, high expectations, disappointing results. It makes sense you'd be cautious."

**Explore:**
"Can I ask what went wrong? Usually, when 'all-in-one platforms' fail, it's one of a few patterns:
1. The platform was a mediocre version of multiple point tools bundled together
2. The 'integration' was really just shared login, not shared intelligence
3. The implementation required too much change management
4. The platform tried to replace rather than connect"

**Reframe:**
"Pravado was built differently because we studied those failures:

First, we're not trying to replace your execution tools. Your CMS, your email platform, your SEO crawler—those can stay. Pravado is the intelligence layer above them.

Second, our integration is about shared state, not shared UI. SAGE knows what's happening in your PR tool because it reads the signals—it doesn't need you to move your PR workflow.

Third, we designed for progressive adoption. You don't have to go all-in on day one. Start with visibility (EVI), add proposals (SAGE), add automation (AUTOMATE) when you're ready."

**SAGE/AUTOMATE Distinction:**
"Here's the key difference: most 'platforms' are really tool bundles with a shared database. Pravado is a strategy mesh with an execution governance layer.

SAGE isn't a dashboard—it's an operating model that maintains state, decays without activity, and learns from outcomes. That's fundamentally different from 'here are 5 tools that share data.'"

### Proof Points
- Architecture difference: "We can show you the technical architecture. You'll see this isn't a rebrand of old-school marketing suites."
- Customer stories: "Customer X came from Marketo's marketing platform and had the same concern. Here's why their experience was different."

### Close Direction
"Would it help to talk to a customer who had similar hesitation based on past platform experiences? I can connect you with someone who's been through both."

---

## Objection 8: "My team won't use it"

### Variations
- "We have tool fatigue."
- "Our team is already overwhelmed with systems."
- "Adoption is always the hard part."

### Underlying Concern
Change management burden. User resistance. Training overhead.

### Response Framework

**Acknowledge:**
"You're right that tools only work if they're used. And yes, marketing teams are dealing with tool fatigue. The last thing they need is another login, another dashboard, another thing to check."

**Reframe:**
"Here's what's different about Pravado adoption:

First, the primary interface is proposals that come to the user. Your team doesn't have to remember to check a dashboard. SAGE pushes proposals based on priority and relevance. The work comes to them.

Second, the value is immediate and obvious. When a team member sees a proposal that says 'This journalist wrote about your competitor yesterday, deadline is Friday, here's a personalized pitch draft'—they get it immediately. There's no learning curve for understanding value.

Third, we replace work, not add it. The cross-tool coordination your team does manually today—that goes away. They spend less time in spreadsheets and meetings trying to connect dots."

**AUTOMATE Connection:**
"And here's the adoption flywheel: as the team executes SAGE proposals and sees results, trust builds. What starts as 'another tool' becomes 'the system that tells me what to do next.' That shift typically happens in weeks, not months."

**Training Reality:**
"Training for Pravado is 2-3 hours, not days. Because we designed for progressive disclosure:
- Week 1: See proposals, understand EVI
- Week 2: Execute basic proposals
- Week 3-4: Customize settings, enable Copilot for trusted actions

Your team is never drinking from a firehose."

### Proof Points
- Adoption metrics: "Average active usage rate after 90 days is 78%. That's not 'shelfware.'"
- Time savings: "Team members typically save 4-6 hours/week on coordination overhead. That's the adoption hook—it makes their job easier."

### Close Direction
"Would a pilot with a small team help? We can start with 2-3 people, let them experience the value, and they become your internal champions for broader rollout."

---

## Objection 9: "We need to see it first"

### Variations
- "Can we get a demo?"
- "I need to show this to my team."
- "How does it actually work?"

### Underlying Concern
This is not really an objection—it's buying signal. Respond appropriately.

### Response Framework

**Immediate Action:**
"Absolutely. Let's set up a demo. A few questions to make it valuable for you:

1. Who should be in the room? Typically, we see marketing leadership plus one person from each pillar (PR, content, SEO) for the fullest picture.

2. What's your biggest pain point right now? I'll make sure the demo emphasizes how Pravado addresses it.

3. Are there competitors you'd like us to analyze? We can show your EVI estimate versus theirs—live in the demo."

**Demo Structure Preview:**
"Here's what we'll cover:
- EVI baseline: Where you stand today across visibility surfaces
- SAGE proposals: What the system recommends based on your current signals
- Influence Field: How actions would affect your entity relationships
- AUTOMATE governance: How execution control works

We'll use your real data, not a generic demo. Much more valuable."

### Close Direction
"When works for you? I can have times ready today."

---

## Objection 10: "I need to involve others"

### Variations
- "I need to run this by my CMO."
- "This affects multiple teams."
- "I'm not the final decision maker."

### Underlying Concern
Legitimate buying process. Not an objection to address, but a step to facilitate.

### Response Framework

**Facilitate, Don't Push:**
"Of course. This decision affects PR, Content, and SEO—getting stakeholder input makes sense. How can I help you make the case internally?

1. **Executive summary**: I can provide a one-pager for your CMO that focuses on EVI and strategic value.

2. **Team-specific demos**: We can do separate sessions for PR, Content, and SEO leads if a joint meeting is hard to schedule.

3. **ROI calculator**: I can provide numbers specific to your situation to help with budget conversations.

4. **Reference call**: I can connect you with a peer at a similar company who can speak to their experience."

**Champion Enablement:**
"What would be most helpful for you in the next conversation? If it's a slide deck, an ROI summary, or answers to specific questions, let me know and I'll have it ready."

### Close Direction
"What's the next step from your side? And what can I do to support that step?"
